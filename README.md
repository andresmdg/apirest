# Fastify Users API

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Notes

* Data is stored in memory ‚Üí restarting the server will reset the user list.
* The `Location` header in `POST /users` points to the new resource URL.
* Validation ensures only valid **name** and **email** fields are accepted.
* This project is meant as a **learning starter template** for beginners.
